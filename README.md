# Creating Customer Segments (Udacity MLND)

## Project Overview
Developed an efficient un-supervised machine learning model to classify customers into different segments based on their annual purchase history.
Data Set : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers
Technologies used: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Things I have learned by completing this project:
- How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
- How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
- How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.
